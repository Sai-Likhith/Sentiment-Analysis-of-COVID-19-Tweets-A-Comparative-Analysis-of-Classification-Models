# Sentiment-Analysis-of-COVID-19-Tweets-A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Classification-Models
This aims to perform sentiment analysis on COVID-19 tweets using various classification models. We preprocess the data, convert words to vectors, and train models such as Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and KNN. Finally, we compare their performance to determine the most accurate model for predicting sentiment in COVID-19 tweets.
